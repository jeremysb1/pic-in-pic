# Picture in a Picture Vanilla JS Project

The purpose of this project is to improve my vanilla JavaScript skills while learning how create a picture in a picture (like a video) with the the Picture-in-Picture Web API. 

I read the API [documentation](https://w3c.github.io/picture-in-picture/) and was able to create the project.
