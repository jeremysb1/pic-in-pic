# Picture in a Picture Vanilla JS Project

The purpose of this project is to improve my vanilla JavaScript skills while learning how create a picture in a picture (like a video) with the the Picture-in-Picture Web API and screen capture API. 

I read Picture in a Picturer API [documentation](https://w3c.github.io/picture-in-picture/) and screen capture API [documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API), and learrned how to create the project.

## What this final project looks like

As an example, I selected a youtube video of a fire burning in the fireplace to play in the background.

As a user, I can resize the image or move it around anywhere on the screen. 

I would use this to play on a separate screen; if I used dual monitors for example.
